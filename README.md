# kwdb - Knowledge Database

Curated context and knowledge for AI-assisted software engineering.

## What This Is

A knowledge synthesis workspace:
- Stores curated context optimized for AI coding agents
- Documents dev tool patterns and configurations
- Houses VKS (Validated Knowledge Synthesis) methodology
- Processes YouTube transcripts into structured knowledge
- Follows RPI (Research-Plan-Implement) and context engineering principles

## Usage

Browse files directly. Each document is self-contained and optimized for quick reference.

Files use VKS methodology: Answer-Explain-Educate structure, Golden Path criteria, progressive disclosure.

## Philosophy

**On-demand compressed context over static documentation.**
Knowledge extracted just-in-time from current codebase state, not from docs that drift out of sync.

See `context-engineering-for-ai-coding-agents.md` for full principles.
