# Android OS


== Visual Voicemail == 

```bash
/data/data/com.tmobile.vvm.application/databases/<number>@vms.eng.t-mobile.com.db_att/

```
Note: Requires Root* 

Copy using Root Explorer to a computer and open the extensionless files with VLC Media Player.  VLC Media Player will automatically detect the codec (SAMR) and play the files.  Timestamp and callback info is stored in the database (.db) file from the ../databases/ folder, but you may also use the Date Modified information from your Android filesystem (use an explorer such as ES File Explorer and look at the date of the files) if you're not concerned about the callback info.)
