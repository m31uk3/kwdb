WGETRC file...
To set up a .wgetrc file under windows, you have two choices

- Set an environment variable called "WGETRC" which points to the full pathname of your wgetrc file
- Set an environment variable called "HOME" (if it doesn't already exist) pointing to a directory. Put your wgetrc file in this directory, and call it 'wgetrc'
