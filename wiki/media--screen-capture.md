Press ALT + Print Screen simultaneously. This places just the active window on the clipboard, rather than the entire screen or desktop.

### Active Sub-Window

**Ctrl+Alt+Print Screen**

Press Ctrl + ALT + Print Screen simultaneously. This places just the active sub-window on the clipboard, rather than the entire screen or desktop.

### Saving the Screen Capture

Once you've completed one of the options above you now have the "Screenshot" saved as an image in your clipboard.

To save this into a file it's easiest to open up MS Paint and then paste the contents of the clipboard into a new document by choosing:

```bash
Edit => Paste

```
After that simply save the file and you're finished!
