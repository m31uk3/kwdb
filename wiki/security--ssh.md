## Login Problems

### Copy & Paste is Bad

If you use copy and paste to change passwords ensure that you thoroughly test the passwords after you change them. It is possible for additional characters to be appended to the password unintentionally.

**Possible Solutions**
- Copy & Paste the password that you think it is and then hit **Backspace** once.
- Try removing trailing characters and beginning characters.
- Try prefixing and or suffixing a space.
