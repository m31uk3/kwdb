# What is this program


= Dog icon, 169k in size, random filenames, C:\Windows\Temp folder =

This is an extension of the **Trend Micro Office Scan** application. It runs in this manner to protect it's self from attack. You can be sure this is a Trend Micro file by the following criteria:

- Randomized and capitalized 6 character alphanumeric filename ending in .EXE
- Process icon is a brown running dog
- File size is 169 kilobytes
- Location is C:\Windows\Temp\

Please keep in mind that there are viruses that use similar tactics to conceal them selfs. If the file is not exactly as described above it is most likely a virus. Please only use this as a reference and conduct your own investigation on the suspect file(s).
