# Xargs Command


**xargs** -- build and execute command lines from standard input

## Introduction

Execute command (with any initial arguments), but read remaining arguments from standard input instead of specifying them directly. xargs passes these arguments in several bundles to command, allowing command to process more arguments than it could normally handle at once. The arguments are typically a long list of filenames (generated by ls or find, for example) that get passed to xargs via a pipe.

## Syntax

**-0, --null**

```bash
   Expect filenames to be terminated by NULL instead of whitespace. Do not treat quotes or backslashes specially.

```
**-e [string] , -E [string] , --eof[=string]**

```bash
   Set EOF to _ or, if specified, to string.

```
**--help**

```bash
   Print a summary of the options to xargs and then exit.

```
**-i [string] , -I [string] , --replace[=string]**

```bash
   Replace all occurrences of { }, or string, with the names read from standard input. Unquoted blanks are not considered argument terminators. Implies -x and -L 1.

```
**-l [lines] , -L [lines] , --max-lines[=lines]**

```bash
   Allow no more than lines nonblank input lines on the command line (default is 1). Implies -x.

```
**-n args, --max-args=args**

```bash
   Allow no more than args arguments on the command line. Overridden by the maximum number of characters set with -s.

```
**-p, --interactive**

```bash
   Prompt for confirmation before running each command line. Implies -t.

```
**-P max, --max-procs=max**

```bash
   Allow no more than max processes to run at once. The default is 1. A maximum of 0 allows as many as possible to run at once.

```
**-r, --no-run-if-empty**

```bash
   Do not run command if standard input contains only blanks.

```
**-s max, --max-chars=max**

```bash
   Allow no more than max characters per command line.

```
**-t, --verbose**

```bash
   Verbose mode. Print command line on standard error before executing.

```
**-x, --exit**

```bash
   If the maximum size (as specified by -s) is exceeded, exit.

```
**--version**

```bash
   Print the version number of xargs and then exit.

```
## Usage

```bash
xargs [options] [command]

```
## Examples

### Moving Files

Using cut, in combination with grep, cat, find, ls, and "etc" to move files:

```bash
ls -lrt | cut -c 35- | grep ^May | cut -c 14- | xargs -iX -t mv X 2007/05-May/X

```
Grep for pattern in all files on the system:

```bash
find / | xargs grep pattern > out &

```
Run diff on file pairs (e.g., f1.a and f1.b, f2.a and f2.b, etc.):

```bash
echo &dollar;* | xargs -n2 diff

```
The previous line would be invoked as a shell script, specifying filenames as arguments. Display file, one word per line (same as deroff -w):

```bash
cat file | xargs -n1 

```
